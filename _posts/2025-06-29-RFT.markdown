In this blog page we describe how we can understand field theories from action principles. Most physical laws can be derived by minimizing the action. The action represents the total energy of the system, which must be conserved. This means that we may determine the equations that govern physical laws by minimizing the action by solving the Euler Lagrange Equations.

Let us consider a system where we have a single particle that describes a trajectory $x(\tau)$ and with velocity ${v}(\tau) = \frac{dx}{d\tau} = \dot{x}(\tau)$, let us also assume that the particle is subjected to some vector potential $A=A(x)$, that does not change in time. The action for this particle is


$$
\mathcal{A} = \int -{m} \dot{x}^2 + qA(x)\cdot \dot{x}\  d\tau \label{eq:action}
$$



The Euler Lagrange equations tells us that in order to minimize $\ref{eq:action}$ on must determine $x=x(\tau)$ that solves

$$
\frac{d}{d\tau}\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{d\dot{x}} - \frac{d\mathcal{L}}{dx}=0\label{eq:euler:lagrange:tau}
$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the lagrangian and is given by $\mathcal{L}(x(t))\equiv -{m} \dot{x}^2 + A(x)\cdot \dot{x}$. The only component of $\mathcal{L}$ that depends explicitily on $x$ is the $A(x)$. Note that we may write the Euler-Lagrange equations in the following form

$$
\partial_\tau \nabla_{\dot{x}}\mathcal{L} - \nabla_{x}\mathcal{L} = 0
$$

To determine the derivative of $A(x)\cdot \dot{x}$ we must define a new quantity. Let $\underline{A}$ be the jacobian matrix of the vector potential $A$, this means that $\underline{A}z\equiv z\cdot \nabla_x A$. And $\bar{A}$ the jacobian transpose, thus $\bar{A}z\equiv \nabla_x z\cdot A$. Taking the derivative $\nabla_x$ of $\mathcal{L}$ one obtains

$$
\nabla_{x}\mathcal{L} = q\nabla_{x}A(x)\cdot \dot{x} = q\bar{A}\dot{x}
$$

While the derivetive with respect to the velocity gives us:

$$
\nabla_{\dot{x}}\mathcal{L} = -2m\dot{x} + qA(x)
$$

Then taking the proper time $\tau$ derivative we obtain

$$
\partial_\tau\nabla_{\dot{x}}\mathcal{L} = -2m\ddot{x} + q\dot{x}\cdot \nabla_x A = -2m\ddot{x} + q\underline{A}\dot{x}
$$

Putting the entire Euler-Lagrange equation together one finds that 

$$
m\ddot{x} = (1/2)q (\underline{A}-\bar{A})\dot x
$$

Note how this almost looks like the Lorentz force Law. Defining the eletromagnetic tensor as 

$$
F = (1/2)(\underline{A}-\bar{A})\label{eq:F:from:potential}
$$

Note that $F$ is skew-symmetric under the metric. This means that the components of $F$ are not skew symmetric but $F$ satisfies $F^\top = -F$. Where the transpose is defined with respect to the inner product, in particular we have $(F^\top x)\cdot y \equiv x\cdot (Fy)$. Recall that the inner product satisfies $e_\mu\cdot e_\nu = \eta_{\mu\nu}$ with $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ the metric of space-time $\eta_{\mu\mu}=\\{-++++\\}$. Under this new definition we finally arrive at the equation

$$
m\ddot{x} = q F\dot{x} \label{eq:lorentz:force:law}
$$

You might recall the similarity of $(\ref{eq:F:from:potential})$ with the formula

$$
F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu
$$



We want to simplify (\ref{eq:lorentz:force:law}) by transforming it to a relation between position and velocity. To achieve that we will take the integral on both sides, and then use the fundamentdal theorem of calculus. 

$$
m\int_{\tau_0}^{\tau_f} \ddot{x}\ d\tau  = q\int_{\tau_0}^{\tau_f} F\dot{x} \ d\tau\ \ \Leftrightarrow\ \ m \dot{x}(\tau_f) - m\dot{x}(\tau_0) = q\int_{x_0}^{x_f} Fd\vec{x} 
$$

Now consider the existence of a vector potential $G$ such that $Fz=z\cdot\nabla_x G=\underline{G}z$, then the integral over $Fd\vec{x}$ takes the form

$$
\int_{x_0}^{x_f} Fd\vec{x} = \int_{x_0}^{x_f}d\vec{x}\cdot\nabla_x G = G(x_f)-G(x_0) = G(x(\tau_f)) - G(x(\tau_0))
$$

Now set $G_0=G(x(\tau_0))$ and $\tau_f\rightarrow \tau$ to finally get the following equation

$$
\dot{x}(\tau) = (q/m) [G(x(\tau)) - G_0]
$$


This shows that the velocity is in fact expressed as a field, that is, it is a function of space-time position $x$. In particular we may consider 

$$
v(x)\equiv\dot{x}(\tau) = (q/m) [G(x(\tau)) - G_0]\notag
$$

This sugests that we may consider a field theory for the velocity field $v(x)$. Let us replace $\dot{x}=v(x)$ in the Lagrangian, then 

$$
\mathcal{L}(v(x)) = -mv^2(x)+A(x)\cdot v(x)
$$

Note that while the previous Lagrangian was a function of $\tau$, this is a function of the space-time vector $x$.

## Solving in Coordinate Time $t$

Now let us consider a different approach to compute the Lorentz Force Law from the action integral. We want to consider some coordinate time $t$ for which the position $X$ of the particle changes let $e_0$ be some arbitrary time coordinate that satisfies $e_0^2=-1$ and $I=e_1e_2e_3$ the subspace where the position vector $X$ resides in. First note that the second term of the Action  $\eqref{eq:action}$ can be expressed as

$$
\int A(x)\cdot \dot{x}\ d\tau = \int A(x)\cdot d\vec{x} = \int A(t,X(t))\cdot \frac{dx}{dt}\ dt
$$

where $x=(t,X)=te_0+X$, and its derivative is $\frac{dx}{dt}=\left(\frac{dt}{dt},\frac{dX}{dt}\right)=\left(1,\frac{dX}{dt}\right)=e_0+\frac{dX}{dt}$. Now let $A_0=A\cdot e_0$, then the integral takes the form


$$
\int A(x)\cdot d\vec{x} = \int A_0 + A_{\mathcal{E}}\cdot \dot{X}\ dt
$$

with $A=(A_0,a)=A_0e_0 + A_{\mathcal{E}}a$, $A_{\mathcal{E}}=P_I(A)=A\cdot II^{-1}$ and $I=e_1e_2e_3$, and where we define $\dot{X}=\frac{dX}{dt}$. The action for the velocity is simply

$$
\int -m \dot{x}^2\ d\tau = \int -m\ d\tau = \int -m \sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}\ dt
$$

where we used the change of variable $\frac{d\tau}{dt}=\sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}=\gamma^{-1}(\dot{X})$ and $\frac{dt}{d\tau}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}}=\gamma(\dot{X})$. The complete action for this system then takes the form:

$$
 \mathcal{A} = \int -m \sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2} + A_0 + A_{\mathcal{E}}\cdot \dot{X}\ dt
$$

The Euler-Lagrange equations for this action will be similar to $\eqref{eq:euler:lagrange:tau}$:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{d\dot{X}} - \frac{d\mathcal{L}}{dX}=0\label{eq:euler:lagrange:t}
$$
or using the sorthand notation for the derivatives:
$$
\partial_t \nabla_{\dot{X}}\mathcal{L} - \nabla_{X}\mathcal{L} = 0
$$

Let us first evaluate the derivative with respect to $\dot{X}$

$$
\nabla_{\dot{X}}\mathcal{L} = m\frac{\dot{X}}{\sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}} +qA_{\mathcal{E}}
$$

and the derivative with respect to coordinate time is:

$$
\partial_t\nabla_{\dot{X}}\mathcal{L} = m\frac{d}{dt}\left[  \frac{\dot{X}}{\sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}}\right] + q\frac{dA_{\mathcal{E}}}{dt}
$$

Then we evaluate the derivative with respect to space coordinate $X$. Thus 

$$
\nabla_{X}\mathcal{L} = q\left[\nabla_XA_0 + \nabla_XA_{\mathcal{E}} \cdot \dot{X}\right]
$$

Now the Euler-Lagrange equations become of the form

$$
m\frac{d}{dt}\left[  \frac{\dot{X}}{\sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}}\right] = q\left[\nabla_XA_0 + \nabla_X A_{\mathcal{E}}\cdot \dot{X}-\frac{dA_{\mathcal{E}}}{dt}\right]
$$

Next note that $A_{\mathcal{E}}=A_{\mathcal{E}}(t,X(t))$ this means that when we take the derivative with respect to coordinate time $t$ of $A_{\mathcal{E}}$ we must consider the chain rule, then

$$
\frac{dA_{\mathcal{E}}}{dt} = \frac{\partial A_{\mathcal{E}}}{\partial t} + \dot{X}\cdot \nabla_X A_{\mathcal{E}}
$$

and yet again we rewrite the Euler-Lagrange equations:

$$
m\frac{d}{dt}\left[  \frac{\dot{X}}{\sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}}\right] = q\left[\nabla_XA_0 + \nabla_X A_{\mathcal{E}} \cdot \dot{X}-\frac{\partial A_{\mathcal{E}}}{\partial t} - \dot{X}\cdot \nabla_X A_{\mathcal{E}}
\right]\label{eq:euler:lagrage:complicated}
$$

Note that to derive the same set of equations as in the last section, it is not possible directly from the above equations. The reader should note that there are no $e_0$ components in the above equation. We could forecast and tell what is missing, instead we will define $\nabla_x \equiv e^0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\nabla_X$, $v=\frac{dx}{dt}=e_0+\dot{X}=e_0+V$ with $e_0=-e_0$ such that $e_0\cdot e^0=1$.

We will show that the right hand side is equivalent to the euclidean component of the following 

$$
\nabla_x A\cdot v - v\cdot\nabla_xA\label{eq:skew:op:A}
$$

It can be noted that we may identify the above as the skew-symmetric part of the jacobian of $A(x)$ aplied to the vector $v$. Expanding the above we have 

$$
-e_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t} A\cdot v + \nabla_X A\cdot v - e_0 v\cdot \nabla_x A_0 - v\cdot \nabla_x A_{\mathcal{E}}
$$

Now we can start to identify the equal components on boths expressions specifically

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla_X(A_0+A_{\mathcal{E}}\cdot\dot{X}) &= \nabla_X A\cdot v\\
\frac{\partial A_{\mathcal{E}}}{\partial t} + \dot{X}\cdot \nabla_X A_{\mathcal{E}} &= v\cdot \nabla_x A_{\mathcal{E}}
\end{align}
$$

While we can transform the right hand side of $\eqref{eq:euler:lagrage:complicated}$ into $\eqref{eq:skew:op:A}$ we must now add a $e_0$ term to the right hand side, this term is

$$
m \frac{d}{dt}\frac{e_0}{\sqrt{1-\dot{X}}}
$$

Now note that 

$$
e_0 + \dot{X} = \frac{d}{dt}(te_0+X) = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d\tau}{dt} \frac{dx}{d\tau} = \sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}\frac{dx}{d\tau}\label{eq:change:vars}
$$

thus the left hand side of $\eqref{eq:euler:lagrage:complicated}$ turns into

$$
m\frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{dx}{d\tau}\right]
$$

We can use $\eqref{eq:change:vars}$ to assert the change of coordinates $v=\frac{dx}{dt}=\sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}\frac{dx}{d\tau}$ and then

$$
\nabla_x A\cdot v - v\cdot\nabla_xA =\sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2} \left(\nabla_x A\cdot \frac{dx}{d\tau} - \frac{dx}{d\tau}\cdot\nabla_xA\right)
$$

Dividing by $\sqrt{1-\dot{X}^2}$ on both sides and noticing that $(1-\dot{X}^2)^{-1/2}=\frac{dt}{d\tau}$ we have

$$
m  (1-\dot{X}^2)^{-1/2}\frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{dx}{d\tau}\right] = m \frac{dt}{d\tau}\frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{dx}{d\tau}\right] = m \frac{d^2x}{d\tau^2}
$$

Thus we may finally write the covariant Lorentz Force Law with respect to the vector potential $A$. In all its glory the Law is

$$
\boxed{
m \frac{d^2x}{d\tau^2} = \nabla_x A\cdot \frac{dx}{d\tau} - \frac{dx}{d\tau}\cdot\nabla_xA
}
$$

Defining the linear transformation operator $F$ as $qFv\equiv \nabla_x A\cdot v - v\cdot\nabla_xA$ and letting the overdot express derivative with respect to proper time we have

$$
m\ddot{x} = qF\dot{x}
$$

### Note about Proper Time

One of the invariants of special relativity is the tiny change of proper-time and this tiny change relates with the magnitude of the tiny change in the space-time position, in particural we have the relation 

$$
d\tau^2 = -dx^2 = dt^2 - dX^2
$$

but now note that a tiny change in $\tau$ can be written as 

$$
d\tau = \sqrt{-dx^2} = \sqrt{dt^2-dX^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dt}{dt}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{dX}{dt}\right)^2}dt = \sqrt{1-V^2}dt
$$

This is a straightforward approach to derive the lorentz factor that comes from the invariance relation. Note that this invariance relation leads us to an invariance relation between frames. Consider $x_1$ to be the position at frame one, while $x_2$ is the position at frame two. By the invariance principal

$$
d\tau^2 = -dx_1^2 = -dx_2^2
$$

This implies that $dx_1$ and $dx_2$ must tranform into each other under Lorentz transformations, namely

$$
dx_1 = L dx_2
$$

with $L=L(x_1)=L'(x_2)$ and satisfying $L^\top = L^{-1}$ and with the $\top$ operator defined as $(La)\cdot b\equiv a\cdot(L^\top b)$ ($\top$ is not the same as matrix transpose, the reader should not be confused by this similarity!!!). Now computing the magnitude of $dx_1$ we have

$$
dx_1^2 = dx_1\cdot dx_1 = (Ldx_2)\cdot(Ldx_2) = (L^\top L dx_2)\cdot dx_2 = dx_2^2
$$

Where we used $L^\top L = I$.
Indeed if $L$ is a Lorentz transformation, the differentials $dx_1$ and $dx_2$ have the same ''magnitude''.


## General Relativity Formulation

In this part we will consider the case of general relativity. The key difference between general and special relativity is that in general relativity space-time is curved. In particular the invariant which is proper time $d\tau$ satisfies the following

$$
d\tau^2 = -(\underline{h}dx)^2 =- dx\cdot (gdx)\label{eq:invariant:gen:rel}
$$

with $h$ the Gauge Tensor, it relates with the metric tensor $g$ via $h^\top h=g$. The invariant in general relativity is now $\eqref{eq:invariant:gen:rel}$. Let us now consider a transformation $x=f(y)$, given this transformation the differential $dx$ transforms as

$$
dx = \frac{dx}{dy}dy = \underline{f}dy
$$

Then the invariant becomes 

$$
d\tau^2 = -dy\cdot (\bar{f}g\underline{f}dy) =- dy\cdot (gdy)
$$

which implies that $\underline{f}$ must satisfy 

$$
\bar{f}g\underline{f} = g
$$

This equation can be solved for $\underline{f}$ by considering the square root of $g$. In particular if we set 

$$
\boxed{
  \bar{f} = g^{1/2}R^{\top}g^{-1/2}
}
$$

Where $R\in\mathbb{R}^{4\times 4}$ is a Lorentz transformation matrix. Then it is trivial to check that 

$$
\bar{f}g\underline{f} = g^{1/2}R^{\top}g^{-1/2} g g^{-1/2}Rg^{1/2} = g
$$

The action for a particle under a gravitational field dictated by $g$ and a electromagnetic field expressed by the vector potential $A$ is of the form


$$
\mathcal{A}_\text{GR} = \int -m \sqrt{-(\underline{h}dx)^2} + q\int \bar{h}^{-1}(A)\cdot \underline{h}(dx)
$$

Note that from the action defined for SR we changed $dx\mapsto hdx$ and $A\mapsto \bar{h}^{-1}A$. This is what will make the theory covariant. Instead of the parameterization considered for special relativity we shall consider an arbitrary parameterization thus we will use

$$
dx = \frac{dx}{d\theta}d\theta= \dot{x}d\theta
$$

with $\dot{x}=\frac{dx}{d\theta}$. Under this parameterization and simplifying the action we find 


$$
\mathcal{A}_\text{GR} = \int -m|ih\dot{x}|d\theta + \int qA\cdot\dot{x}\!\ d\theta
$$

with $i$ the imaginary unit $i^2=-1$. The Euler Lagrange equation for this action is

$$
\frac{d}{d\theta}\nabla_{\dot{x}} \mathcal{L} - \nabla_x \mathcal{L}=0
$$

The derivative of the lagrangian with respect to the velocity $\dot{x}$ is

$$
\nabla_{\dot{x}} \mathcal{L} = m\frac{\bar{h}\underline{h}\dot{x}}{|i\underline{h}\dot{x}|} + q A
$$

taking the derivative with respect to $\theta$ we have 

$$
m\frac{d}{d\theta}\left[\frac{\bar{h}\underline{h}\dot{x}}{|i\underline{h}\dot{x}|}\right] + q \dot{x}\cdot\nabla_x A
$$

The derivative with respect to $x$ gives

$$
\nabla_x \mathcal{L} = m\frac{\nabla_x \underline{h}(\dot{x})^2}{|i\underline{h}\dot{x}|} + q\nabla_x A\cdot \dot x
$$

The Euler-Lagrange equations have the final form:

$$
m\frac{d}{d\theta}\left[\frac{\bar{h}\underline{h}\dot{x}}{|i\underline{h}\dot{x}|}\right] + q \dot{x}\cdot\nabla_x A - m\frac{\nabla_x \underline{h}(\dot{x})^2}{|i\underline{h}\dot{x}|} - q\nabla_x A\cdot \dot x = 0
$$

Now we are going to remove the $\|i\underline{h}\dot{x}\|$ by noticing that dividing $\eqref{eq:invariant:gen:rel}$ by $d\theta^2$ gives us an expression of the form

$$
|i\underline{h}\dot{x}| = \frac{d\tau}{d\theta}
$$

and 

$$
\frac{dx}{d\theta} = \frac{dx}{d\tau}\frac{d\tau}{d\theta} = \frac{dx}{d\tau} |i\underline{h}\dot{x}|
$$

Now note that 

$$
\frac{\underline{h}(\dot{x})^2}{|i\underline{h}\dot{x}|} = \frac{|i\underline{h}\dot{x}|^2\underline{h}(dx/d\tau)^2}{|i\underline{h}\dot{x}|} = |i\underline{h}\dot{x}|\underline{h}(dx/d\tau)^2
$$

After all of this change of parameterizations we will arrive at the following equation

$$
m\frac{d}{d\tau} g\dot{x} = q(\nabla_xA\cdot\dot{x} + \dot{x}\cdot\nabla_xA) + m \nabla_x \dot{x}\cdot g(\dot{x}) = qF\dot{x} + m\nabla_x\dot{x}\cdot g(\dot{x}) 
$$

where now the dot represents derivative in proper-time $\tau$. Comparing with what was obtained for the Special Relativity case we note that there is an additional term, namely $m\nabla_x\dot{x}\cdot g(\dot{x})$ is a quadratic term that makes the equation quadratic in $\dot{x}$.



Now recall that the metric tensor $g$ depends on $x$, this means that we must consider the chain rule and the product rule for $\frac{d}{d\tau} g\dot{x}$, letting $\dot{g} = \frac{dg}{d\tau} = \dot{x}\cdot\nabla_x g\dot{x}$ we rewrite the equation in the form

$$
m g\ddot{x} = -m\dot{x}\cdot\nabla_x g\dot{x} + qF\dot{x} + m\nabla_x\dot{x}\cdot g(\dot{x})
$$

Now let $g(x)\dot x=G(x,\dot{x})$ then define $\underline{G}v=v\cdot{\nabla_x} G$ and $H=\bar{G}-\underline{G}$, then the equations can be written in the following form

$$
mg\ddot{x} = mH(x,\dot{x})\dot{x} + qF(x)\dot{x} = (mH(x,\dot{x})+qF(x))\dot{x}\ \Leftrightarrow\ m\ddot{x} = g^{-1}\left(mH(x,\dot{x})+qF(x)\right)\dot{x}
$$



$$
\boxed{
m\ddot{x} = g^{-1}\left(mH(x,\dot{x})+qF(x)\right)\dot{x}
}
$$

<!-- Now we want to rewrite the equations to explicitily show that the proper-time velocity depends on two components, the analog to the vector potential $G(x)$ and a field that comes from the curvature of space time, let us call it  -->



## A change of variables for the Action

Let us consider the following action

$$
\mathcal{A} = \int - m\sqrt{dy^2} + \int (\nabla_y \phi)\cdot dy
$$

Now consider the following relations when we take the change of coordinates $y=h(x)$

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla_x &= \frac{d}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dx}\frac{d}{dy} = \bar{h}\nabla_y\\
dy &= \frac{dy}{dx}dx = \underline{h}dx
\end{align}
$$

Thus $dy= \underline{h}dx$ and similarly $\nabla_x = \bar{h}\nabla_y$. With $\underline{h}v\equiv v\cdot\nabla_x h$. Then it is straightforward to see that 

$$
(\nabla_y\phi)\cdot dy = (\nabla_y\phi)\cdot(\underline{h}dx) = (\bar{h}\nabla_y\phi)\cdot dx = (\nabla_x \phi')\cdot dx
$$

with $\phi'(x)=\phi(f(x))$. Note that while $(\nabla_y\phi)\cdot dy$ remains the same value under a coordinate transfortion, the tiny distance measure becomes

$$
dy^2= (\underline{h}dx)^2
$$

And the action takes the new form

$$
\mathcal{A} = \int - m\sqrt{\underline{h}(dx)^2} + \int (\nabla_x \phi')\cdot dx
$$


## A note on the metric tensor

We start by defining a system of coordinates 

$$
\{e_\mu\ |\ \mu=0,1,2,3 \}
$$

that is compatible with the metric tensor

$$
g_{\mu\nu} = e_\mu\cdot e_\nu
$$

Note that each basis vector is a vector field, that is $e_\mu=e_\mu(x)$. A vector $v$ can be expressed through its covariant components $v^\mu$ as a linear combination of the basis vectors, then 

$$
V = v^{\mu}e_\mu
$$

note however that we can express the covariant components via the standard basis, in particular we define 

$$
v = v^\mu \gamma_\mu 
$$

The role of $\underline{h}$ is made clear when we define it as the map from the $\gamma_\mu$ to the $e_\mu$, in other words $e_\mu = \underline{h}\gamma_\mu$ thus we can express the upercase $V$ as 

$$
V = \underline{h}v
$$

Now that we have this more concise definition of a vector expressed in the metric tensor basis, we can easily derive the covariant derivative. Simply take the directional derivative of $V$, to obtain

$$
a\cdot\nabla_x V = (a\cdot\nabla \underline{h})v + \underline{h}(a\cdot\nabla_x v)
$$

from here we may define the covariant directional derivative as 

$$
D_a v = (a\cdot\nabla \underline{h})v + \underline{h}(a\cdot\nabla_x v)\ \Leftrightarrow \ D_a = a\cdot\nabla \underline{h} + \und{h}a\cdot\nabla_x 
$$

Then we define a covariant directional derivative for each of the basis vectors $$a=\gamma_\mu$$, then defining $\partial_\mu=\gamma_\mu\cdot\nabla_x$, and $$\und{h}_\mu=\partial_\mu \und{h}$$ and abusing notation to write $$D_{\gamma_\mu}=D_\mu$$, we have

$$
D_\mu \equiv \und{h}_\mu +  \und{h}\partial_\mu
$$

This definition extends over to arbitrary multivector fields by considering $\underline{h}$ to express the outermorphism transformation. In particular we consider that for some bivector $$A=a_1\wedge a_2$$ we have 

$$
\und{h}A = \und{h}(a_1)\wedge \und{h}(a_1)
$$

Similarly $\und{h}_\mu$ shares the same property, i.e. $$ \und{h}_\mu A = \und{h}_\mu(a_1)\wedge \und{h}_\mu (a_1) $$. Thus $$ \und{h}_\mu $$ not only expresses the derivative of the operator that transforms vectors into vectors but also of its extension as an outermorphism, that is $$\und{h}_\mu=\partial_\mu \und{h}$$ is the derivative of the multilinear operator $\und{h}$. The covariant derivative on $A$ is 

$$
D_\mu A = \und{h}_\mu(A) + \und{h}(\partial_\mu A) = \und{h}_\mu(a_1)\wedge \und{h}_\mu (a_1) + \und{h}(\partial_\mu a_1)\wedge\und{h}(a_2) + \und{h}( a_1)\wedge\und{h}(\partial_\mu a_2)
$$

Note that we have to be carefull when evaluating $\und{h}(\partial_\mu A)$, we must first allways evaluate the derivative and only after can we apply the outermorphism. We have defined the covariant derivative as an operator that transforms vector and multivector fields linearly, it applies linear transformations and computes derivatives, however each $D_\mu$ is a derivative on a single direction in particular in the $\gamma_\mu$ direction. To form the full covariant derivative we have to include the $\gamma_\mu$ components, to motivate such a construction we express the normal derivative as

$$
\nabla = \gamma^\mu \gamma_\mu \cdot \nabla = \gamma^{\mu} \partial_\mu
$$

from this expression it should be sensible to construct a covariant derivative in the same manner, that is, 
$$
D = \gamma^\mu \gamma_\mu \cdot D = \gamma^{\mu} D_\mu
$$

however because $D_\mu$ is a multilinear differential operator we don't fully understand the meaning of the product $\gamma^{\mu} D_\mu$, thus the full vector covariant derivative simply defined by the operator equation $D= \gamma^{\mu} D_\mu$. In order to make full sense of this new operator we must understand how it acts on elements, when we look at the expression $\gamma^\mu D_\mu A$ we read it in the following manner: Apply the operator $D_\mu$ first then multiply by $\gamma_mu$, this can be illustrated using parenthesis 

$$DA = \gamma^\mu D_\mu A = \gamma^{\mu}(D_\mu A) = \gamma^\nu\cdot (D_\mu A) + \gamma^\nu\wedge (D_\mu A)$$

to recall how this operator acts recal that it does not make sense to multiply a vector $\gamma^\mu$ with a linear operator. We now define two particular cases of the covariant derivative. If we regard $D$ as a vector we can imediatly write that 

$$
DA = D\cdot A + D\wedge A
$$

Letting $A=A_r$ be of grade $r$ we have that 

$$
DA_r =  D\cdot A_r + D\wedge A_r = \langle DA_r\rangle_{r-1} + \langle DA_r\rangle_{r+1}
$$

this suggests the following definitions for covariant divergence and covariant curl 

$$
\begin{align}
D\cdot A_r &\equiv \langle DA_r\rangle_{r-1} = \langle \gamma^\mu (D_\mu A_r)\rangle_{r-1}\\
D\wedge A_r &\equiv \langle DA_r\rangle_{r+1} = \langle \gamma^\mu (D_\mu A_r)\rangle_{r+1}
\end{align}
$$

this definition extends for a multivector of multiple grades $A=\sum_r A_r$ thus $D\cdot A \equiv \sum_r D\cdot A_r$ is well defined. Even though $D$ is not a vector, it can be regarded as one since it operates in the same manner as $\nabla$ operator. Another important definition is the directional derivative,

$$
a\cdot D = a\cdot\gamma^\mu \gamma_\mu\cdot D = a\cdot\gamma^\mu D_\mu = a^\mu D_\mu
$$

the covariant directional derivative is just the linear combinations of the operators $D_\mu$ weighted by the components of $a$.



### The covariant derivative on linear operators


Consider some matrix operator $T$, similar to the operator $D_\mu$. In the classical sense the operator applied to the gradient vector $\nabla$ reads

$$
\dot{T}\dot{\nabla}  = \partial_\mu T \gamma^\mu
$$


Taking into observation this expression then the operation $\dot{T}\dot{D}$ must be expressed as the following 

$$
\dot{T}\dot{D} \equiv D_\mu T\gamma^\mu = (\underline{h}_\mu +\underline{h}\partial_\mu)T\gamma^\mu
$$

Thus we will have two terms on this expression, the first is $$\underline{h}_\mu T \gamma^\mu$$ which simply means: apply the composition of the linear transformation $$\underline{h}_\mu$$ to the linear operator $T$ and then evaluate the result $$(\underline{h}_\mu T)\gamma^\mu$$. The other part of the equation can be interpeted as, apply the derivative $\partial_\mu$ to $T$ to get $T_\mu\equiv \partial_\mu T$, then compose $\underline{h}$ with $T_\mu$ and apply that result to the vector $\gamma^\mu$.


The laplacian operator must also be considered for instance the normal laplacian is 

$$
\nabla^2 = \nabla\cdot\nabla = \partial_\mu\partial^\mu
$$

In a similar fashion we can define the covariant Laplacian 

$$
D^2 = D\cdot D \equiv D_\mu D^\mu
$$

where $D^\mu=\gamma_\mu^2 D_\mu$. But this definition does not comply with the laplacian of $\underline{h}A$, instead we must compute the Laplacian of this quantity

$$
\nabla^2 \underline{h}A = (\partial^\mu\underline{h}_\mu)A + \und{h}_\mu(\partial^\mu A) +(\partial^\mu \und{h})\partial_\mu A + \und{h}\partial^\mu\partial_\mu A
$$

this suggests the following definition for $D^2$ 

$$
D^2 \equiv \underline{h}_\mu^\mu + \und{h}_\mu\partial^\mu  + \und{h}^\mu\partial_\mu  + \und{h}\partial^\mu\partial_\mu 
$$


with the subscript $\mu$ index meaning derivative $\partial_\mu$ and the supscript meaning $\partial^\mu$.

The goal of this new definitions is to express the energy-momentum conservation law in the form 

$$
\boxed{
\dot{T}\dot{D} = 0
}
$$

where $T\in\mathbb{R}^{4\times 4}$ is the energy-momentum rank-2 tensor, or just a matrix.

# Densities

To define densities covariantly we must consider a representation that expresses the density with direct reference to some reference frame. We will consider the following line integral

$$
\rho(x) = \int_\ell \delta(x-x')dx' = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(x-x(\tau))d\tau
$$

with $x(\tau)$ some arbitrary function of $\tau$. We shall see that when $x(\tau)=\tau e_0 + X_0$, with $e_0^2=-1$ and $X_0\cdot e_0=0$ the integral reduces to a stationary mass in the reference frame $\\{e_0,e_1,e_2,e_3\\}$.
